				<th colspan="2">Reasonings Behind My Choices (Pros and Cons)</th>
  			</tr>
 			<tr>
    				<td>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</td>
    				<td>Ransom Riggs</td>
    				<td>4 out of 5</td>
				<td>This book has a very unique and interesting concept. I really enjoyed how things progressed in this first book.</td>
				<td>The romance with the main character was a little off putting. There was also a few times where points or logic in the book contradicted each other.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    				<td>The Selection Series</td>
    				<td>Kierra Cass</td>
    				<td>3 out of 5</td>
				<td>These books were quite... interesting. The covers are stunning and I really loved the side characters.</td>
				<td>Things progressed oddly and some things did not make sense. I did not like the ending very much.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
    				<td>Cinder</td>
    				<td>Marissa Meyer</td>
    				<td>5 out of 5</td>
				<td>Love love love this take on Cinderella. Another unique premise and really love how it changes the details of a classic fairy tale.</td>
				<td>A bit predictable at points.</td>
