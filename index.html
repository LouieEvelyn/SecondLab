  			</tr>
 			<tr>
    				<td>Miss Peregrine's Home for <br>Peculiar Children<br></td>
    				<td>Ransom Riggs<br></td>
    				<td>4 out of 5<br></td>
				<td>This book has a very unique and interesting concept. <br>I really enjoyed how things progressed in this first book.</td>
				<td>The romance with the main character was a little off putting.<br> There was also a few times where points or logic in the book contradicted <br>each other.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
    				<td>The Selection Series<br></td>
    				<td>Kierra Cass<br></td>
    				<td>3 out of 5<br></td>
				<td>These books were quite... interesting. <br>The covers are stunning and I really loved the side characters.</td>
				<td>Things progressed oddly and some things did not make sense. <br>I did not like the ending very much</td>
